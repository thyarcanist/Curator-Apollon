When it comes to contributing to this project, Curator Apollon, key help is needed in the song metadata (as spotify's API is closed and Tune Bat doesn't have an API); so we will need a community sourced data gathering.

Once that's robust we can add feature that will match the imported songs metadata to the data sourced song metrics on import.
The other thing that would need refinement is the entropy recommendation itself; The goal is for it to reflect, you, the user in songform. 
It's for the serious music listeners and the audiophiles.

The only source of entropy should come from the Occybyte API, I will see about having a key specifically for this and how to actually implement that in a way that it won't get abused.
