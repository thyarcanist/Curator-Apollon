# Curator Apollon - MVP Specification
*Minimal Viable Product for Personal Music Analysis & Discovery*

## Core Purpose
A personal tool to analyze music libraries and discover new tracks based on music theory relationships and customizable entropy.
Going to open source it for community-curated metadata gathering, my own API will be used to power the randomness. At the minimum,
it can be used to import and then export a playlist without doing anything fishy because that's saved in your personal cache.
